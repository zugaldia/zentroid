Drop some markers and I'll let you know the ideal location to meet your friends for a beer.

You can see the app in action here: http://zugaldia.github.com/zentroid

When you click on the map a marker at that location will be added. When you have two or more we'll automatically drop an X with the [centroid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centroid) location.

NOTES
-----

* The interactive map is handled by [MapBox's Wax](http://mapbox.com/wax) and [CloudMade's Leaflet](http://leaflet.cloudmade.com).

* The tiles are based on the beautiful [MapBox Streets](http://mapbox.com/maps) and are hosted by MapBox.

* If you make any changes to src/zentroid.js you need to re-minimize it with [Closure](https://developers.google.com/closure) or change the link in the HTML head.
